Tools: Html/CSS, Javascript

For this assignment, I was given an html document and data to create a filter using Javascript.

UFO level 1: 
 Using Javascrip, I creaded a filter to filter the UFO siting data based on the date/time. This filter is limited to date/time only.
 
UFO level 2:
 For the next part of this assigment, I created a filter that gave the user more options giving the user more options for the filter based on date/time, city, state, country, and UFO shape. This filter can be used with one, a few, or all of the options given.
